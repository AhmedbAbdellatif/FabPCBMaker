## Project Development
I developed this project as a final project for FabAcademy 2017. My idea was to make it possible to make a CNC mill for PCBs in a FabLab at an as low as possible cost (less than 100â‚¬). 
In this page I will be providing Information on how to replicate this along with the design files required
